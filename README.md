## README.txt File for Beautifull Lib

Final Project for the Introduccion to Computer Science course at UTEC 2018.
In this project we use python together with:

- Beautiful soup (for parsing large strings)
- Flask (creating html files)
  
In here, we use a scrapping script in order to obtain the data from a specific webpage (libgen) of several books depending on the name of the field.
After obtaining the data, it is order and presented in tables.
Finally, this data is shown in a html file easy to read.
